        <h2>DIFFERENT DIVISIONS UNDER NUMBER SYSTEM</h2>
        <div id="uns">
            <h3>Unary Numeral System</h3>
            <p>The simplest number system of numerals is the unary numeral system, in which<i style="color: blue;"><b>" each and every natural
                number is represented by an equivalent number of symbols".</b></i> They are denoted by /, for instance, then the
                number seven would be represented by /////// such that we must write seven /.Tally marks represent one
                such system which is still in regular use. But, the urinary system can only be used for numbers which
                are of a smaller size with a small value, although this plays a related role in theoretical computer
                science. Do you know Elias gamma coding, which is generally used in data compression, denotes
                arbitrary-sized numbers by using unary to indicate the length of binary numbers?For example, if / stands
                for one, * for ten and - for 100, then the number 304 can be compactly represented as --- //// and the
                number 123 as - ** /// without any need for zero and this is called sign-value notation.</p>

            <h3>Binary Numeral System</h3>
            <p>A binary number is used in the system of mathematics, and the world of science.<i style="color: blue;"><b> "In this system, the
                numbers are expressed in the form of a base-2 system or binary numerical system, which uses only two
                numbers that are 0's (zeros) and 1's (ones)".</b></i> The positional representation is done with a <u>radix of 2 </u>
                the base-2 system.In computers, the main system of numbers is based on the positional system in base 2
                which is a binary numeral system, with two digits of binary, 0's and 1's. Positional systems received by
                grouping binary digits by three, which is the octal numeral system or four which is the hexadecimal
                numeral system, are commonly used. For very large numbers, bases 232 or 264, you can group the binary
                digits by 32 or 64, which is the portion of the machine word.Number system represents a valuable set of
                numbers that consists of<u> natural numbers, integers, real numbers, irrational numbers, rational numbers
                and so on</u>.</p>

            <h3>Natural Numbers</h3>
            <p><i style="color: blue;"><b>"The natural (or counting) numbers are from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, etc".</b></i> <u>Natural numbers are infinite
                numbers.</u> The set of natural numbers, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...}, is denoted by N in short form.<u>whole
                numbers start from 0 and include the natural numbers.</u>The addition of any 2 natural numbers is also a
                natural number (for instance, 4 + 5000 = 5004), and the product of any two natural numbers is also a
                natural number (4 × 3500 = 14000). The subtraction and division of any two or more natural numbers is
                not equal to natural numbers, though.</p>

            <h3>Integers</h3>
            <p><i style="color: blue;"><b>"Integers are natural numbers consisting of the set of real numbers, their additive inverses and

                denoted by J or Z in short form. <u>These integer values can be represented on the number line.</u> These
                <u>numbers can be a whole number or decimal numbers.</u> You can represent -6.5 on a number, 6 on a number
                line.The addition, product, and difference between any two integers is also an integer. But this is not
                true for division.</p>

        <div id="rn">
            <h3>Rational Numbers</h3>
            <p><p><i style="color: blue;"><b>"Rational numbers are figures which can be formulated as a ratio between two integers".</b></i> For instance, the
                fractions 13 and −11118 are both rational numbers. <u>Rational numbers include all the integers</u> since any
               <u> integer is denoted by z</u>.All decimals which terminate are rational numbers (since 8.27 can be written as
                827/100.) <u>Decimals which are a recurrent pattern in nature after some point are also called a rational
                number.</u></p>

            <h3>Irrational Numbers</h3>
            <p><i style="color: blue;"><b>"An irrational number is a number that cannot be written as a proportion (or fraction)"".</i></b> The irrational
                number does not end or repeats in a decimal form. The ancient Greek mathematician discovered that not
                all integers are rational numbers; <u> are equations that cannot be solved using ratios of
                integers.</u><u> The square root of 2 is about 1.414, because 1.4142=1.999396,which is almost equal to 2. You
                will never get the exact number by squaring the fraction (or terminating decimal numbers).</u>  The square
                root of 2 is an irrational number, meaning its decimal equivalent goes on forever, <u>with no repetitive
                pattern</u></p>

            <h3>Real Numbers</h3>
            <p><i style="color: blue;"><b>"Real numbers are the set of numbers containing all the irrational numbers and all the rational numbers."</i></b>
                They consist of<u> “all the numbers”</u> on the number scale. Real numbers are infinite numbers just as there
                are infinitely many numbers in each of the other sets of numbers. But, the infinity of the real numbers
                is a bigger infinity.</p>

                numbers include the set of<u> real numbers, which includes the set of both rational and irrational numbers.</u>
                The real numbers, in the complex system, are denoted in the form a + 0i = a. a real number.This set is
                always denoted by C in the short form. The set of complex numbers is significant because for any
                polynomial p(x) with real number coefficients, all the solutions of p(x) = 0 will be in C.</p>
